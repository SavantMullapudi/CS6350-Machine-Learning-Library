## Decision Tree
The decision tree is implemented for the datasets car and bank as a part of HW-1.

## Commands To Run
Decision Tree on car dataset: python3 car_decision_tree.py

Decision Tree on bank dataset -unknown as feature value (enter 1): python3 bank_decision_tree.py

Decision Tree on bank dataset -unknown as missing (enter 0): python3 bank_decision_tree.py

Use #Packages Scripts accordingly dependent on numpy, pandas, scikitlearn and matplotlib
